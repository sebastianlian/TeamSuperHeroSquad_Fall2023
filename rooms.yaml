      You are standing in the middle of the master bedroom, next to the bed.
      The clock on the nightstand emits enough light to show the door in front of you.
      You hear soft music coming from the partially shaded hallway.

      You are entering the dimly lit hallway. To the north, a small lamp reveals a variety of books and stationery on the
      desk and a bookcase behind it. You notice a soft melody that seems to be coming from this room.
      To the east, the hallway opens up to a better-lit, open space. Strangely, you hear a soft, consistent tapping and smell
      a mildly sweet aroma. To the south lies the master bedroom, a dark room with a big bed in the middle.
      The only source of light is the clock on the nightstand. The thick curtains in the window are preventing any light
      from coming inside. To the west, you observe a door to another bedroom illuminated by a large-screen TV. You are
      surprised that there is no sound coming from it.

      You are at the door of the guest bedroom. The light from the large-screen TV on the dresser gives away the simplicity
      of the room. The ruffled bed covering indicates that someone had recently watched TV in quiet.

      You are entering the office. The small lamp allows you to see several crumpled pieces of paper and a broken
      pencil next to the books on the desk. The soft music sound is louder, but you find that it is not originating from
      this room. To the east there is a closed door which seems to lead to the source of the music and more light. To the
      south, there is an open door which leads to a dimly lit hallway.

      You are at the entrance to the living room. An elegant chandelier lights up the room and a small speaker is
      playing soft, relaxing music. To the north, there is an opening that leads to an entrance area with a large black
      coat rack and an umbrella holder. To the south, there is another opening leading to a well-lit room from which the
      tapping and sweet smell was heard, along with a soft voice. To the west, a door provides entrance to a partially lit
      room where a small lamp reveals a variety of books and stationery on the desk and the bookcase behind it.

      You are entering the kitchen area. You are pleasantly surprised to notice a stack of pancakes on a plate and a half-full
      bottle of maple syrup on the kitchen's counter. There are a few other food items next to the plate including freshly
      sliced strawberries, whipped cream, and a cup of milk. Your wife's phone is on the counter, softly playing a cooking
      show on YouTube. To the north, an opening leads you to a quaint area with a welcoming ambiance. An elegant
      chandelier envelops the room with light and a small speaker is playing calming music while two comfortable sofas
      invite you to relax. To the east, there is a door that leads to an unknown place. To the south, there is a sliding
      door with darkly tinted glass that seems to lead outside. To the west, there is the entrance to a dimly lit hallway.

      You are standing in front of your backyard. You immediately feel a cold, damp breeze on your body and see numerous
      puddles in the grass. The sky was grey, the clouds still drizzling. To the north, the tinted sliding door offers
      relief to the warm kitchen and delicious pancakes. To the west, you see the entrance to your workshop.

      As you enter the workshop, you feel saddened looking at your unfinished motorcycle. Your tools are still on the floor
      waiting for you to return, but the strong smell of gasoline interrupts your thoughts.

      While entering the garage, you observe that your dog's bowl is empty. The light coming through the window made you
      aware of the unopened boxes yet to be organized. To the west, you see your shiny black pickup truck.
