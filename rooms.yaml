      You are entering the dimly lit hallway. To the north, a small lamp reveals a variety of books and stationery on the
      desk and a bookcase behind it. You notice a soft melody that seems to be coming from this room.
      To the east, the hallway opens up to a better-lit, open space. Strangely, you hear a soft, consistent tapping and smell
      a mildly sweet aroma. To the south lies the master bedroom, a dark room with a big bed in the middle.
      The only source of light is the clock on the nightstand. The thick curtains in the window are preventing any light
      from coming inside. To the west, you observe a door to another bedroom illuminated by a large-screen TV. You are
      surprised that there is no sound coming from it.

      Tumbled bookshelves, tables turned on their sides, and chairs stacked in odd configurations give the place an air

      a gargantuan zombified librarian, her once neat bun now haphazardly falling apart, glasses skewed. With an ominous
      (yet slightly comedic) creak, she points a bony finger at you.
    explored: "Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..." she draws out with a dramatic flair, her voice echoing across the vast hall.
                
      "Late returns?" she asks, her eyes twitching.
                
      You try to contain your laughter, and respond, "I swear, I always return my books on time!"
                
      The librarian narrows her eyes, then unexpectedly whips out an oversized due-date stamp, ready to mark you overdue.

      air tickles the nose, reminding you weirdly of Aunt Mabel's failed broccoli casserole experiments.
    explored: On a nearby  counter, a robot cleaner seems to have gone rogue, skating in the ooze and making "Weee!"noises,
      creating even more chaos.
      
      It's clear that Grizzly University's science department has had a day to remember... or forget. You can't help but
      wonder, "Do I really want to know what's in section two?"

    explored: From the back of the room, there's a muttering sound. Approaching cautiously, you discover a zombie
      hunched over a desk, scribbling furiously with a piece of chalk. It's wearing tattered professor's robes and a name
      tag that reads, "Professor Square Z."
      
      Seeing you, the zombie groans and points at an equation. "Ugh...Can't... solve...Pythagorean theorem... Need...

      is a zombie donning a disheveled scientist coat, scribbling equations furiously on a clipboard.
    explored: He looked up, adjusting the half-broken glasses on his nose. "Ah, a fresh mind! Call me Professor Z," he
      croaked, motioning to his name tag which was just a piece of masking tape with "Prof. Z" written in wobbly handwriting.
      
      "I've been attempting to perfect the ultimate latte formula for the Bear's Cafe. Before you exit, you must help me
      solve this complex caffeinated equation. Only then will you be granted passage... and perhaps, a sample of the perfect latte."

      Tattered banners hang limply from the ceiling, depicting a once-proud bear mascot, now smeared with unidentified grime
      and with googly eyes unceremoniously stuck onto them, giving the mascot a comically startled look.

    explored: Rows of shelves that once proudly displayed Grizzly University merchandise are toppled over. T-shirts with slogans
      like "Grizzly Pride" and "Bear with Us" are strewn around, some of them fashioned into zombie-chic outfits displayed
      on eerily still mannequins. A collection of mugs lay shattered on the floor, forming a ceramic mosaic of the university emblem.

    explored: Icicles hang from the overhead lamps, twinkling like Christmas decorations. Chairs and tables are buried under
      mounds of snow, with only the tops visible, making them look like little snowy hillocks. Frozen coffee cups sit abandoned on

      the stifling heat makes it difficult to even catch a breath.

      passionate lecture, a name tag pinned to its tattered lab coat reading "Dr. Frankizom."
      
      "...And that's why it's essential to stay hydrated in such conditions," Dr. Frankizom exclaims, pointing at a chart

      to freedom. But as you step onto the floor, a deep, earth-shaking growl fills the room.
    explored: Emerging from the shadows is a massive, decaying version of the school's beloved mascot, Grizzly. His
      once-plush fur is now mottled with patches of exposed skeletal structure, and one eye hangs a little looser than
      the other. Yet, surprisingly, this zombified bear doesn't look menacing. Instead, he holds a basket filled with...
      vegetables?
      
      "Ah, a fresh face!" Grizzy booms, in a voice that's a mix of growl and enthusiasm. "You know, it's important
      to have a balanced diet. Brains are all good and fun, but have you tried kale? It’s a superfood, you know."
      
      Around the room, there are posters showcasing the benefits of various veggies with slogans like
      
      "Beets - the real heart-healthy choice!" and "Carrots - see the benefits!"
      
      You blink, taken aback by the surreal sight of a giant zombie bear advocating for healthy eating. "So, if I munch
      on some broccoli, will you let me pass?"
      
      With a sigh, you realize you’re about to negotiate your escape with dietary choices. Only at Grizzly University
      would the climax involve veggies and a health-conscious zombie bear.

    description: The ambiance of the Dean's Lair is strikingly different from the rest of the university. The elegant wooden
      panels, plush carpeting, and well-maintained decor seem untouched, a stark contrast to the chaos outside. The dim
      chandeliers overhead cast a warm glow over the room, but there's an eerie silence.
      
      As you tread carefully, a tantalizing aroma wafts through the air, growing stronger with each step. Following
      their nose, they come upon a large, ornate door with the title "Dean's Dining Room" engraved in golden lettering.
    explored: Pushing the door open, they're met with an unexpected sight, a grand dining table is laid out with a
      sumptuous spread, complete with sparkling silverware and crystal goblets. The food, however, isn't what one might
      expect at a dean's dinner. Among the dishes, there's a platter of finger foods (which are, alarmingly, actual fingers),
      brain pâté, and what looks to be a risotto with chunks of... something unidentifiable.
      
      At the head of the table, a chef's hat bobs up and down. As it turns, you sees a zombie chef, diligently tasting
      a broth, then adding a sprinkle of what looks to be "Ghoul's Salt." The zombie chef, upon noticing you, straightens up,
      clearly proud.
      
      "Ah! An audience! Have you come to taste Dean's Delight?" you gulp, wondering how you'll navigate this culinary
      escapade in the heart of the Dean's Lair.

    explored: Suddenly, a grand double door at the end of the corridor bursts open, revealing a vast, torch-lit chamber.
      At its center stands a figure with a towering chef's hat, holding a spatula like a warrior would wield a sword.
      His apron, stained with mysterious splatters, bears the name "Chief le Brains."
      
      "Ah, the main course has arrived," he says with a sinister grin, pointing the spatula at you.
      
      You gulp, realizing that this isn't just a battle of brawn but also one of wits. "I heard your culinary skills are unmatched,
      Chief le Brains," the student begins, trying to buy some time and strategize. "But can you handle the heat of competition?"
      
      Chief le Brains laughs, "You wish to challenge me in culinary combat? Very well. But be warned, the stakes are high."
      
      The room transforms, revealing a kitchen battleground complete with sizzling grills, boiling pots, and an array of ingredients.

      bar stocked with an array of beverages, both non-alcoholic and otherwise, greet you. Neon lights subtly backlight
      the shelves, giving a chill lounge feel.
      
      There are plush sofas surrounding a fireplace, and above it, a massive portrait of the dean, looking sophisticated
      and mysteriously smug. However, the odd juxtaposition of the chic environment amidst the chaos of the rest of the
      university makes you wary.
      
      Settling on a barstool, you survey the room. Suddenly, the sound of ice clinking against glass breaks the
      silence. From behind the bar emerges a zombie bartender, immaculately dressed, stirring a crimson concoction.
    explored: "Greetings," it rasps, presenting the drink with a flourish. "I call it 'Bloody Brains'. Care for a taste?"
                
      You raise an eyebrow, "I think I'll pass, given the recent... menu options I've encountered."

      to feed you, here, it's all about choices. Choose wisely, and you might just reach the Dean."

      fog obscures the ground. Faint, ghostly whispers echo through the chamber, recounting tales of past students who dared
      challenge the Dean.
      
      You tighten your grip on your bag, mentally reviewing your inventory. The vial of antidote from the science lab, the
      knowledge of the math riddles, the veggie from Grizzy's cafe, and a token from Chief le Brains's culinary duel. Each
      item, a testament to the your journey and resolve.

      student places each item on its respective pedestal. As the final token settles, a resonating click echoes through the

      Beyond lies the Dean's sanctum. As you cautiously proceeds, the weight of your journey and the challenge ahead bears

      precariously.
      
      You dash towards the exit as the room collapses, escaping just in the nick of time. As you emerge into the
      sunlight outside, the university grounds slowly return to normal. Students, no longer zombified, look around in confusion,
      their memories of the ordeal hazy.
      
      Grizzly University is saved, and tales of the brave student who outwitted the Dean will become legends whispered in the
